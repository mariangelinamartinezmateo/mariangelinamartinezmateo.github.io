				<p>Hi!!! My name is Mariangelina Martinez Mateo and I am a rising sophmore at East Palo Alto Academy. I'm a young latinx women that hopes to attend Stanford University. </p>
				<p>I was in over 10 extracurricular programs durning the school year, which consisted of two sports; Basketball and Latin Dance Specializing in BalletFolklorico, leadership programs, lead in the play Real Women have Curves and Tutoring peers in math and physics.</p> 
				<p> I attend East Palo Alto Academy and take extra college classes in east palo alto. I commute anywhere from an hour to 30 mins to go to school, but its all worth it for a better education.</p>
				<p>I'm a hard working young lady that's striving to leave her mark on the world and am slowly making this dream a realality with the help of programs like SMASH, Boost, and BGCP.</p>
